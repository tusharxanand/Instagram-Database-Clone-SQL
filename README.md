# Instagram-Database-Clone-SQL
Instagram is a popular social networking site for sharing photos and videos. Despite the fact that its original DB Schema is fairly complex, this is an attempt to represent the fundamentals of relationships between tables in a real world Database Design.

I have performed data analysis for various real world business related questions and scenarios such as:
  - Find out the rewarding system for the loyal users
  - Launching campaign to target the weekdays with the most user registerations
  - Encouraging inactive users to log in back to the system
  - etc. .
